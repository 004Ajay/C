# Uploading C Programs that I studied


## C - PROGRAMMING BASICS

---

/ * & * / is used for multi line commentin (without space b/t * & /) 

---
This is how a normal C-Program looks like

/*

Author's name & other details

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   printf("Hello, World!"); //displays the string inside quotation
   return 0;

}

---

// is used for single line commenting

---

#include - preprocessor directive

---

<stdio.h> - header file or library

---

int main(){} or void main(){} - The first function that is going to work in any C program, no matter how many other User-Defined Functions(UDFs) present.

Data type before main denotes the data type of the return value.

---

{} - inside these brackets, we can write the code.

---

return - here, this keyword returns 0, that says to the compiler that the program has ended with no errors, we don't need return 0 in main function in linux systems
